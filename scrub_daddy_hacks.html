                <h2>Why Scrub Daddy Is a Cleaning Game-Changer</h2>
                <p>Before diving into the hacks, let's first take a look at what makes Scrub Daddy stand out in the world of cleaning products:</p>
                
                <div class="features-grid">
                    <div class="feature-card">

                        <h3>Temperature-Controlled Scrubbing</h3>
                        <p>Scrub Daddy's unique Flex Texture® technology gives you full control over its scrubbing power. The sponge becomes soft in warm water for gentle cleaning, while it firms up in cold water to tackle tougher messes, like burnt food and grease. This adaptability makes it ideal for a variety of surfaces and cleaning tasks.</p>
                    </div>

                        <h3>Odor-Resistant</h3>
                        <p>Traditional sponges tend to trap bacteria, resulting in unpleasant smells. Not Scrub Daddy! Thanks to its open-cell structure, Scrub Daddy resists bacteria buildup, helping to keep it odor-free, even after extended use. This means no more smelly sponges lingering in your kitchen.</p>
